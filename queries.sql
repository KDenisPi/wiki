-- Example queries against the DuckDB database built by load_duckdb.py.
--
-- There is no duckdb CLI in the venv, only the Python library, so run them
-- from a session:
--
--   /home/denis/projects/venv3.11/bin/python
--   >>> import duckdb
--   >>> con = duckdb.connect('wiki.duckdb')
--   >>> con.sql("<paste a query>").show()
--
-- Tables: items, events, attributes, item_classes, value_items, classes,
-- properties. Queries 1 and 2 run on any build; the rest need attributes and
-- item_classes, which only exist after a run made with --attrs.


-- 1. What happened in a given year in music and science.
--    Items are matched through every class they belong to, and classes carry
--    the domain tag assigned by build_class_closure.py.
